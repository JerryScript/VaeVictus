Shazam module is at arch/arm/mach-msm/shazam.ko

You gotta write a script for this to be able to work with your rom. Maybe like put the script in /system/xbin/ then
the user types shazam and it'll execute the script, load the module and viola! OC to 2.5 GHz!!!

(First time only)
Code:
adb push shazam.ko /data/local
Code:
adb shell
su
mount -o rw,remount /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/system /system
mv /system/etc/thermald.conf /system/etc/thermald.conf.bak
reboot

Load the overclock (every time you reboot):
1. Load the kernel module (replace pll_l_val and vdd_uv with your desired voltages and L value as explained above. It defaults to 67 and 1300000 if you don't give it any parameters):
Code:
adb shell
su
insmod /data/local/krait_oc.ko pll_l_val=67 vdd_uv=1508000
2. Bring core 1 temporarily offline so it gets updated with the new max frequency:
Code:
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
3. You'll now have an additional CPU frequency! SetCPU can configure your maximum frequency up to this speed. You can also choose to keep running at 1.5GHz at any time - this method doesn't eliminate any available frequencies. Set the max at 1.8GHz to verify it's stable here.
4. Restart thermald by running "ps". Look for "thermald" in the list, and find thermald's pid (it's usually a number in the low hundreds, higher up in the list). Run "kill [thermald's PID]" in adb shell. The kernel does not currently have kernel-level temperature throttling turned on, so thermald is important for now.

Remove the overclock by restoring your backup of thermald.conf:
Code:
adb shell
su

rm -r /system/etc/thermald.conf
mv /system/etc/thermald.conf.bak /system/etc/thermald.conf
reboot
Rebooting clears any kernel modules that are loaded, so you're now clean. You can then delete anything left over in /data/local, but it doesn't matter.
